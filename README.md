# Prompt Font

Prompt in Thai also means ready.

Prompt is a Loopless Thai and Sans Latin typeface. This simple and geometric Latin was developed to work harmoniously with Loopless Thai that has wide proportion and airy negative space. It is suitable for any layout and communication usage such as magazine, newspaer, poster, and other print media.
