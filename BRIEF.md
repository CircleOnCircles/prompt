#Prompt Font

The objective of this project is to create a formal loopless Thai and Sans Latin typeface. Prompt, a geometric sans serif typeface influenced by Avenir and the early modernist era, was designed by optically adjusting circles to create a clear, natural typeface with great legibility. Itâ€™s a versatile, modern sans, and highly legible as a body text and elegant as a display at larger sizes. Prompt family comprises of 9 weights with matching italics. For further development, this typeface can be extended the family to narrow and extended version, or matched with other non-latin script.
